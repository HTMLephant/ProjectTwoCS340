How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The most efficent way to make a program adaptable is to break the functionality into individual components that each get their own method.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 
My approach is generally to comment in the individual methods that I need and then work on them one at a time. This project was different because the methods were mostly complete except for a few critical components that I found to be quite difficult. Plotly Dash is an extremely capable and slick utility that makes it simple to generate interactive plots.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists try to find the most efficient way to tell a computer to do something.
